# stats

This package is a golang rewrite of the R implementation of the Wilcoxon test.
This package also contains functions and types to assist with the statistics
used in pairwise analysis. This package was originally written for CABE.

Please refer to
[Usage of R in CABE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FaVWQXNGE-rSXh3G9XRKlZqcCCiKE1laSzHeqNQoA6s/edit#)
for more information and quantitative verification of the golang calculations
against the R calculations.
