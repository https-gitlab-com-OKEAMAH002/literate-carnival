[anchor-position] Implements resolving anchor-center.

This patch implements the layout-time anchor-center logic.
In part based on:
https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/4919956

This patch:
1) Pulls the alignment logic out into its own struct, and step.
    See: ComputeAlignment()
2) Adds a step for computing the anchor-center position if necessary.
    See: ComputeAnchorCenterPosition()
3) Adjusts the logic in ComputeOutOfFlowInsets() to coerce any auto
    insets to zero if anchor-center is present.
4) Adds special logic in ComputeInsetModifiedContainingBlock() to
    coerce the available-size in a similar manner to center static
    position.
